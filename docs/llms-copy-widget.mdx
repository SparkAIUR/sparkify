# LLM Markdown Copy

`sparkify` generates LLM-friendly markdown outputs by default and exposes a floating copy widget in the bottom-right corner.

## What gets generated

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/llms.txt` | Index of available markdown exports |
| `/llms-full.txt` | Single-file markdown for the full navigable docs site |
| `<route>/index.html.md` | Per-page markdown export (`/index.html.md` for home) |

## In-site widget actions

- `Copy Page as Markdown` copies the current page markdown export.
- `Copy Site as Markdown` copies `/llms-full.txt`.

The widget uses static files from your built docs output, so users can paste directly into LLM tools without scraping rendered HTML.

## Disable if needed

```json
{
  "llms": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

When disabled, llms artifacts are not emitted and the widget is hidden.

## Deployment notes

- Works with non-root base paths (`--base /repo`) because widget requests are base-path aware.
- Site-level export scope follows navigable pages, including generated API pages.
