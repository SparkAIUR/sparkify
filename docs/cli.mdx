# CLI Reference

The MVP command surface is planned as:

- `sparkify init`: scaffold docs structure and starter files.
- `sparkify dev`: run local preview with file watching.
- `sparkify build`: produce static output for deployment.
- `sparkify doctor`: validate environment and project configuration.
- `sparkify export-openapi`: export OpenAPI from FastAPI (`app.openapi()`).

## Config

Planned config file:

- `sparkify.config.json` (name may be finalized during implementation)

See internal spec details in `refs/docs/04-cli-spec.md`.
