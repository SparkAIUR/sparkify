## Build baseline

```bash
npx sparkify build --site https://<domain> --base /<repo-or-subpath>
```

## Decision matrix

| Requirement | Recommended option |
| --- | --- |
| Lowest operational overhead | GitHub Pages |
| Private network deployment | Self-hosted container |
| Existing reverse proxy stack | Self-hosted container |
| Public OSS docs in repo | GitHub Pages |
