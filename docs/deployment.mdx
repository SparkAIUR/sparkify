# Deployment

`sparkify` targets static hosting, with GitHub Pages as the primary deployment path.

## Build (Planned)

```bash
npx sparkify build --site https://<user>.github.io --base /<repo>
```

## GitHub Pages Requirements

- Set the correct `base` path for repo pages.
- Upload the generated `dist/` directory as the Pages artifact.
- Deploy via GitHub Actions (`actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`).

## Common Pitfalls

- Broken asset paths caused by missing or incorrect `--base`.
- Route links that are not base-path aware.

See CI/CD planning details in `refs/docs/10-ci-cd-release.md`.
