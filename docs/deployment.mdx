# Deployment

## Build

```bash
npx sparkify build --site https://<user>.github.io --base /<repo>
```

## GitHub Pages workflow essentials

- Build docs to `dist/`
- Upload `dist/` with `actions/upload-pages-artifact`
- Deploy with `actions/deploy-pages`

## Pitfalls

- Wrong `--base` causes broken routes/assets
- Missing `site` can break canonical URLs
