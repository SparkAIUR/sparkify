# API Playground

The MVP includes an interactive API playground embedded in the docs site.

## MVP Direction

- Provider-first implementation (Stoplight first, pluggable design).
- OpenAPI-driven reference rendering.
- Client-side request execution for Try It.

## Networking Constraints

Because GitHub Pages is static hosting:

- Target APIs must allow CORS, or
- You must configure an external CORS proxy.

## Auth & Server Selection

Planned UX supports:

- API key auth
- Bearer token auth
- Basic auth
- Base URL selection from OpenAPI `servers` (or override)

See internal design spec in `refs/docs/06-api-playground-spec.md`.
