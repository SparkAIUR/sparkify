# sparkify

Welcome to the public documentation for `sparkify`.

This `docs/` directory is intentionally used as a dogfooding target for the project itself.

## Current Status

- Planning and architecture are tracked internally in `refs/`.
- Public-facing usage and product docs will be maintained here.

## Next

As implementation starts, this site will document:

- Installation and quickstart
- CLI usage (`init`, `dev`, `build`, `doctor`, `export-openapi`)
- GitHub Pages deployment
- OpenAPI playground configuration
